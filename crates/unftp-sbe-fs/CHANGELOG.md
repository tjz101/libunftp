## 2021-05-22 unftp-sbe-fs 0.1.1

_tag: unftp-sbe-fs-0.1.1_

- Support for the SITE MD5 command has been added. For the Filesystem
  backend it relies on the default libunftp implementation. Please
  note that it needs to be explicitly enabled by passing one of the
  `libunftp::options::SiteMd5` options to the `.sitemd5()` method of
  the Server struct.
